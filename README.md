## Learning Points

I worked on this app when studying at Codeclan, mainly over the festive break and in the first weeks of the new year, with an aim to keep up my JS/React skills, as well as getting some additional practice handling API Data. 

- Creating multi-component web application with React.
- Making multiple API Requests to load JSON data in the application.
- Designing CSS for a mobile-first focus.
- Deploying to GitHub pages.


## Version

The demo linked above is currently version 1.0 of the project at the moment. In future, I'd like to potentially add some more additional features (eg search, more info from wikipedia etc) to enhance the app and continue to develop my skills.

## Run Locally

This is a React app, so you'll need npm and node.js installed and relatively up to date.

Clone the project and go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd nobel_prize_browser
```

Install dependencies and start the app:
```
npm install
npm start
```

The application will run on port 3000 so visit http://localhost:3000/ to try out!
